This is a stale Aquamacs Emacs branch.
=========================================

At the end of 2014, Emacs replaced its git repository with a new one.
This branch reflects development of Aquamacs Emacs against the old GNU Emacs git repository.

Now, a new Aquamacs master branch has been recreated, containing all new Aquamacs
development since late 2014 and merging with the new Emacs repository.

The following replace reference links the two branches:

git replace 2f9ab01d8342d029ea54ff13f7d012d47091f923 69699f60547c27c6b896c7f3ae3d26c818280462

(The replace reference is not fetched automatically by current Git versions.)

This lets us see the correct history, but merge against the new Emacs repository.
